# Acceptance Testing

[Acceptance testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acceptance-testing-software-testing/#) in software development is the process of evaluating a software system to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements and is ready for deployment. 
The primary goal of acceptance testing is to ensure that the software meets the expectations of the end-users or stakeholders and is suitable for production use. 
This is the final stage of software testing performed after **[System Testing](System_Testing.md)** and before the system is deployed for usage.


## Types of Acceptance Testing

* User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
  - UAT is conducted to verify whether the software meets the user's needs and expectations.
  - It involves end-users or representatives from the target audience interacting with the system to validate its functionality in a real-world scenario.
* Contract Acceptance Testing (CAT):
  - This type of testing is performed to ensure that the software system complies with the terms and conditions specified in the contract or agreement between the development team and the client.
* Regulation Acceptance Testing (RAT):
  - When the software needs to comply with specific regulations or industry standards, regulation acceptance testing is conducted to verify adherence to those requirements.
* Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT):
  - OAT evaluates the software's operational aspects, such as system maintenance, backups, and recovery procedures.
  - It ensures that the operations team can manage and maintain the software effectively.
* Alpha Testing:
  - Alpha testing is performed by the internal development team before the software is released to external users.
  - It helps identify bugs, issues, and usability concerns within the development environment.
* Beta Testing:
  - Beta testing involves releasing the software to a limited group of external users who use it in a real-world environment.
  - The goal is to collect feedback, identify potential issues, and make necessary improvements before the official release.
