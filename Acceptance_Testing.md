# Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing in software development is the process of evaluating a software system to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements and is ready for deployment. 
The primary goal of acceptance testing is to ensure that the software meets the expectations of the end-users or stakeholders and is suitable for production use. 
This is the final stage of software testing performed after **[System Testing]**(System_Testing.md) and before the system is deployed for usage.
