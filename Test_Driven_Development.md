# Test Driven Development

* Is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
  - Requirements are turned into very specific test cases,
  - Then the code is improved so that the tests pass
 
* This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements.
