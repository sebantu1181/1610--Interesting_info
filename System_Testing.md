# System Testing
* System testing is a level of software testing where the complete and integrated software system is tested as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements.
* The purpose of system testing is to evaluate the system's compliance with the specified functional and non-functional requirements.
* In simple terms, system testing is conducted to ensure that all parts of an application work together seamlessly as a complete and unified whole.
* The primary goal is to detect any inconsistencies, errors, or issues that may arise when the components of the application are integrated, and to verify that the entire system functions as intended. including:
  * performance,
  * security,
  * reliability, and
  * other aspects.


### Few Types of System Testing:

1. Integrated Testing
   - System testing involves testing the interactions and interfaces between different components or modules of the software to ensure that they work together as intended.
2. Functional Testing
   - This aspect checks whether the software functions according to the specified requirements.
  - It involves testing features, data manipulation, user interfaces, and other functional aspects of the system.
3. Performance Testing
  - Tests the system's performance under various conditions, such as load testing to assess its behavior under heavy usage,
  - stress testing to check its response to extreme conditions, and
  - scalability testing to determine how well it can handle growing amounts of data or users.
4. Usability Testing
  - This aspect measures how user-friendly the system is.
  - It considers factors such as user interfaces, navigation, and overall user experience.
5. Security Testing
  - The system is tested for vulnerabilities and potential security risks to ensure that sensitive information is protected and that the system is resistant to unauthorized access. 
6. Compatability Testing
  - Verifies that the software works correctly with different operating systems, browsers, and other third-party components. 
7. Reliability and Availability Testing
  - Assesses the reliability and availability of the software under normal and exceptional conditions.
  - It checks whether the system can recover from failures and how it handles errors. 
8. Regression Testing
  - Any changes made during development or maintenance are tested to ensure that existing functionality is not negatively affected.
